### 4. **Steps to Push to GitHub:**

After creating your local project and setting it up:

1. **Initialize Git:**
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit - AICrafter AI project"
    ```

2. **Push to GitHub:**
    - If your GitHub repository is already created, push the code:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/AICrafter.git
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
    ```

Now, the project is on GitHub! The README file provides a good overview and usage instructions, making it easy for others to contribute or use the project.
